Description
This mod adds the ability to Auto Select Personnel and Items when forming a caravan

Each time you create a caravan, you select who you want, what food, and what items you want to sell at another colony.  a lot of these selected items repeat each time, don't you wish there was some way you could automate a large part of this selection.

Additional Info

Caravan forming using Auto Caravan Equip is separated into three parts, Global, Per Personnel and Late Global.

Global

If your rule is of type Global (not to be mistaken for Late Global), then it will change the quantities of the caravan before the Caravan Form window even shows.  This is ideal for setting things like Personnel to take.  To make a Global type, leave the Apply to Personnel root blank and make sure Process Last is unchecked.

Per Personnel

if your rule is of type Per Personnel, then it changes quantities after you select your route, then it checks the Personnel Root against who has already been set by a Global Type and multiplies by the number of who you take, this is excellent for setting food to take (be sure to set a waypoint back to base for the return journey) or if a certain person needs to take drugs with them.  To make a Per Personnel type, you just have to set the Apply to Personnel Root to check for who this rule applies to.

Late Global

Similar to Global, but this changes quantities after you set the route, this is more useful for setting items you wish to take to sell, or things you need to take each time.  To make a Late Global type, leave the Apply to Personnel root blank and make sure Process Last is checked
